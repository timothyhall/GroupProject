\ 20. Theater Ticket Sales

Create a `TicketManager` class and a program that uses it to sell tickets for a single performance theater production. This project is intended to be designed and written by a team of two to four students. Here are some suggestions:

* One student might design and write the client program that uses the class, while other team members design and write the `TicketManager` class and all of its functions.
* Each student should be given about the same workload.
* The class design and the names, parameters, and return types of each function should be decided in advance.
* The project can be implemented as a multi-file program, or all the functions can be cut and pasted into a single file.

Here are the specifications:

* The theater's auditorium has 15 rows, with 30 seats in each row. To represent the
	seats, the `TicketManager` class should have a two-dimensional array of
	SeatStructures. Each of these structures should have data members to keep
	track of the seat's price and whether or not it is available or already sold.
* The data for the program is to be read in from two files located in the
	Chapter 8 programs folder on this book's companion website. The first one,
	`SeatPrices.dat`, contains 15 values representing the price for each row. All
	seats in a given row are the same price, but different rows have different prices.
	The second file, `SeatAvailability.dat`, holds the seat availability information.
	It contains 450 characters (15 rows with 30 characters each), indicating which
	seats have been sold (\'\*\') and which are available (\'\#\'). Initially all seats are
	available . However, once the program runs and the file is updated, some of the
	seats will have been sold. The obvious function to read in the data from these
	files and set up the array is the constructor that runs when the `TicketManager`
	object is first created.
* The client program should be a menu-driven program that provides the user
	with a menu of box office options, accepts and validates user inputs, and calls
	appropriate class functions to carry out desired tasks. The menu should have
	options to display the seating chart, request tickets, print a sales report, and exit
	the program.
* When the user selects the *display seats* menu option, a `TicketManager` function
	should be called that creates and returns a string holding a chart, similar to
	the one shown here. It should indicate which seats are already sold (\*) and
	which are still available for purchase (\#). The client program should then
	display the string.

* When the user selects the *request tickets* menu option , the program should
	prompt for the number of seats the patron wants , the desired row number,
	and the desired starting seat number. A `TicketManager` ticket request function
	should then be called and passed this information so that it can handle the
	ticket request. If any of the requested seats do not exist, or are not available,
	an appropriate message should be returned to be displayed by the client
	program. If the seats exist and are available, a string should be created and
	returned that lists the number of requested seats, the price per seat in the
	requested row, and the total price for the seats. Then the user program should
	ask if the patron wishes to purchase these seats.
* If the patron indicates they do want to buy the requested seats, a
	`TicketManager` purchase tickets module should be called to handle the actual
	sale. This module must be able to accept money, ensure that it is sufficient to
	continue with the sale, and if it is, mark the seat(s) as sold, and create and
	return a string that includes a ticket for each seat sold (with the correct row,
	seat number, and price on it).
* When the user selects the *sales report* menu option, a `TicketManager` report
	module should be called. This module must create and return a string holding
	a report that tells how many seats have been sold, how many are still
	available, and how much money has been collected so far for the sold seats.
	Think about how your team will either calculate or collect and store this
	information so that it will be available when it is needed for the report.
* When the day of ticket sales is over and the *quit* menu choice is selected, the
	program needs to be able to write the updated seat availability data back out
	to the file. The obvious place to do this is in the `TicketManager` destructor.
